        I finally managed to get a snowday on Monday! It was great to have a break from classes and just relax at home. 
        However, I don't care for the mess the storm left and how Siena isn't quick to clean up. I nearly slipped multiple
        times today walking to class. I also had to do a lot of shoveling and snowblowing since there was over a foot of snow
        at my home.
