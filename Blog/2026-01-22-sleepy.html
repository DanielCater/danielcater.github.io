        This week has been exhausting! I have so many new classes and homework assignments to keep track of. 
        I'm looking forward to the weekend so I can get some rest and recharge for next week. Hopefully, I 
        can find a good balance between my studies and relaxation. It's also very unfortunate that I have all
        early classes this semester, but at least I get done earlier.
